#DIY Solar Generator
A DIY solar generator is a self-contained and portable mini-power plant that you can use to power and charge your gadgets and even small appliances and be 100% independent from the grid.

As of 2017, solar energy is the cheapest source of energy in the world and one of the rare few alternative sources that cause no pollution or negative environmental effects.

Solar energy users worldwide save the planet 75 million barrels of crude oil each year, which is a huge step in making our planet green again.

But apart from being eco-friendly and cheap, solar energy is also incredibly convenient — you can access it everywhere and use it any time, even at night.

Parts and Components

Rugged case — You need a waterproof, weatherproof, and above all sturdy casing that will hold all the vital parts.

It needs a Rugged Case which is fitted with several rugged handles, as well as a pair of rolling wheels eg "Pelican 1620 Case"

AC solar power inverter — With a solar power inverter, you transform the DC voltage that is stored in your battery into AC voltage that appliances use.

Solar panel — The solar panel absorbs the sun’s energy and supplies it to the battery. Your panel will be one of the most exposed elements of the generator, so it needs to be high-quality and durable as well.

Battery — Your generator needs a battery to store solar energy. Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, but your best shot is either a lithium-ion or deep-cycle lead-acid battery.
